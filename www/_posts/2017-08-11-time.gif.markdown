This is a GIF that always shows the current time in UTC:

<!--more-->
![time.gif](/time.gif)

[Source Code](https://github.com/def-/time.gif)

It is written in Haskell and works by dynamically generating each frame of the GIF and slowly feeding them over the HTTP connection.

This is cannibalized from [gifstream](https://github.com/def-/gifstream), which lets you play snake and have people watch a GIF livestream. It was actually created as a Christmas exercise for students of the Programming Paradigms course at KIT.
