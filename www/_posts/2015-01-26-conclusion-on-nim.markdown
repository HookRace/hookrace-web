In my last two posts, "[What is special about Nim?](/blog/what-is-special-about-nim/)" and "[What makes Nim practical](/blog/what-makes-nim-practical/)", I forgot the important conclusion - why I personally have decided for Nim in favor of Rust, C++, Python and Haskell:

Nim is not the fastest language, it's not the easiest language to write in and it surely has some flaws that should be fixed. Nim has no single "killer feature" like go's goroutines or Rust's memory management. But Nim doesn't need a killer feature. Instead it strikes a reasonable balance that makes it the most efficient language for me:

- I can produce reasonably efficient code (faster than Python and Haskell)
- that is reasonably readable (more so than Rust, C++ and Haskell)
- in a reasonable amount of time (less than Rust, C++ and Haskell)
